      <p>
        As a software engineer with a Maths and
        Physics degree and a teaching background, I
        bring a unique combination of technical skills,
        problem-solving abilities, and the ability to
        communicate complex ideas effectively. My
        experience as a teacher has honed my ability to
        explain complex technical concepts to non-
        technical stakeholders and to mentor and guide
        team members.<br/><br/>

        My mathematical background and passion for
        problem-solving, coupled with my ability to
        quickly learn new technologies, enables me to
        deliver innovative and efficient solutions that
        drive business growth and success.<br/><br/>

        I am eager to work in a dynamic and
        collaborative environment that fosters growth
        and provides opportunities to learn from
        experienced professionals. I am dedicated to
        expanding my knowledge and expertise to
        contribute to the success of the team and
        organization while striving to achieve my career
        goals</p>
